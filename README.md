R Data Analysis Project from DataFlair 

This data analysis project uses data visualizations to understand Uber pickup rides in New York City between April 2014 and September 2014.

There are six .csv zip files that were used for this project, they contain data for each month between April and September 2014. The original .csv files were too large to add into this repository, therefore the zip files were uploaded.
